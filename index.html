                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>
                    Denji has a simple dream—to live a happy and peaceful life, spending time with a girl he likes. This
                    is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to
                    pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for
                    a bit of cash.
                    <br> <br>Unfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with
                    the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and
                    grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a
                    revived Denji uses his new abilities
                    to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who
                    arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the
                    means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage
                    dreams. (Information from MyAnimeList)
